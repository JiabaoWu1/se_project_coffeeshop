# Project Name: Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

Project Description: This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I want to dig into more animation tools because they help bring energy to the website and it is more visually appealing to the viewer. I also need to work on positioning because that is where I found most difficulties throughout the project.
